        "This notebook provides a practical introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP) concepts using SpaCy. It demonstrates how to load and process text, perform tokenization, sentence segmentation, and extract linguistic attributes such as POS tags, dependency tags, and lemmas. Additionally, it covers pattern matching with spaCy's Matcher to identify specific phrases within the text. The exercises in this notebook are applied to the classic tale \"The Three Little Pigs,\" obtained from [Proyecto Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/18155/pg18155.txt), Comments, spaCy version, and the story used will be in English.\n",

        "\n",
        "Working through The Three Little Pigs with spaCy turned out to be a good way to get a feel for basic NLP. We loaded the text, split it into tokens and sentences, and pulled out POS tags, dependencies, and lemmas—so instead of just seeing words we could see how the story is put together grammatically.\n",
        "\n",
        "The lemma frequency list was handy to see what the story is really about: \"pig\" and \"little\" show up a lot, which makes sense, and \"project\" / \"gutenberg\" are there too because of the header. So without reading the whole thing you get a quick idea of what it revolves around.\n",
        "\n",
        "The POS bar chart gave a similar kind of overview—lots of nouns and verbs, which fits a short narrative with characters and actions. Nothing fancy, but it shows how you can look at style through grammar.\n",
        "\n",
        "Where things got a bit funny was NER. The default model (en_core_web_sm) sometimes got it wrong: \"Pigs\" as an organization, \"chin chin\" as a person, etc. So for a made-up story the out-of-the-box model isn't always reliable—you'd need something tuned to your kind of text if you care about getting entities right.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Matcher was the opposite: we knew we wanted \"little pig\" and \"blow your house\" and it found them without a problem. When you have a clear phrase in mind, rule-based matching like that is simple and does the job.\n",
        "\n",
        "So in the end we mixed a bit of stats (frequency, POS), a bit of visualization, NER (with its limits), and the Matcher—and got a more concrete sense of what's in the text. Even with a simple story like this one, that combo is useful."
